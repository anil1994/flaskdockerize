# Containerised Python Application 
This containerised Python application uses Flask. It is a simple example for AWS EC2 Demo.

My application listens flask default port 5000.

I can dockerize this flask application by using dockerfile

I can expose my application via Elastic Load Balancer

I used nginx on this project.
